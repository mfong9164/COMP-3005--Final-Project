can create a view to view unpaid bills with a memebr and admin info

create a index on ParticipatesIn.class_id since we will frequently check how many memebrs are in a class to enforce capactiy

can create a trigger on a new column paid_date for Bill table when a Bill status chnages from False to True (unpaid to paid) which will automatically
set the paid_date to the current date

The relationship function tells python how the classes are connected in the database. it links two mapped classes together and lets you go from one
object to its related attributes (like member.bills). eliminates the need to write sql joins. basiucally just makes the db links in pyton attributes
making it feel more natural than a pile of tables. 

it tells the orm which class (table) is on the other side. then when you access the relationship attribute on an object, SQLAlchemy automatically
generates and executes the necessary sql query to get the data

back_populates tells sql alchemy these two attributes are the two ends of the same relationship and to keep them in sync.
relationship() defines the link; back_populates pairs the two sides of that link.

Need to normalize this db schema next, the write functions.
